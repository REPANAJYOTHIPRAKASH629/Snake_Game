<strong>
Based on the provided code for the Snake game, several concepts have been implemented:
<br><br><br>
Swing GUI Components: The game is built using Swing components like JFrame, JPanel, and JLabel for displaying graphics and handling user input. <br><br><br>
Event Handling: Event handling is utilized for keyboard input using KeyListener and KeyAdapter to control the movement of the snake.<br><br><br>
Graphics Rendering: Graphics are drawn onto the screen using Graphics object methods like drawImage() to display the snake, apple, and game over messages.<br><br><br>
Game Loop: The game runs in a loop, driven by a Timer object, to continuously update the game state and repaint the screen.<br><br><br>
Collision Detection: Methods are implemented to detect collisions between the snake's head and the apple or the snake's body, determining whether the game is over.<br><br><br>
Randomization: The position of the apple is randomized within the game board.<br><br><br>
Game State Management: The game keeps track of whether it's in progress or over (inGame variable) and stops the timer when the game is over.<br><br><br></strong>
